The payday and short-term loans arranged by the reviewed companies provide the first of two decisions you’ll need to borrow money. The first decision, which you are guaranteed to receive quickly, is whether you prequalify for the loan.

Prequalification does not ensure that you’ll receive the loan, but it is a necessary step in achieving that end.

The second decision is rendered by a direct lender lined up by the lender-matching service. The direct lender will collect additional information and then quickly render a final decision on your loan request, including interest, fees, and repayment date if the loan decision is positive.

Before agreeing to the loan offer, please take the time to read the fine print — the loan terms and conditions the lender must provide when asking for your e-signature. Once you accept the loan, expect the proceeds to arrive in your checking account in as few as one business day.

If you accept a payday loan, you’ll be expected to repay it in full on the due date tied to your next payday — usually one to two weeks away. If you can’t repay the loan on time, you can roll it over by paying additional fees and interest, perhaps at a higher interest rate. This is a risky maneuver, as your debt will snowball if you continue to roll your bad credit payday loan over, leading to a debt spiral and possible bankruptcy.

A short-term, bad credit personal loan is a smarter alternative for several reasons. The most important is that you repay the loan in manageable monthly payment installments. While these loans offer a minimum loan term of three months, you can stretch them out longer to reduce the size of the monthly payments.
