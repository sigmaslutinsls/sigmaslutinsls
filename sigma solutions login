The two-step application processes for the lending networks we review here are all basically the same, whether you apply for a short-term online personal loan or an online payday loan. The job of these lender-matching companies is to find you a direct lender that is willing to work with you even if your credit is bad.

The first step is to prequalify for a bad credit loan online by providing basic information about your citizenship/residency, your income, your rent or mortgage, as well as your Social Security number, checking account number, email address, and phone number. This step does not include a hard credit inquiry that would hurt your credit score.

The second step involves the networks of direct participating lender organizations, including banks, private lenders, tribal lenders, and other sources with deep experience serving consumers that have low credit scores. You can now finish applying for the bad credit loan by providing any additional requested information, but you are under no obligation to proceed.

If you do want to go forward, the direct personal or payday loan lender will usually do a hard pull of your credit history from a credit bureau â€” either Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. Expect the hard pull to drive down your credit score by five to 10 points for up to a year. You should receive an immediate final decision on your online loan application.
